## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Functionality only with CSS

### What I learned

Had some practice with the relative units of measurement (rem, vh, vw etc.). Furthermore, I learned about transitions and how to apply them.

### Continued development

I am looking forward to honing my CSS skills so that I can create more projects without the use of JS.

### Useful resources

- [Anchor tag FAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXrtXg1kpVs) - Youtube video about creating a FAQ by using <a> tags for the questions and the :target pseudo-class for the hide/show functionality.
