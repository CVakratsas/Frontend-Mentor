## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Due to the fact that it's my first html and css project, I learned a lot of things regarding the way a project can be structured,
but it all felt a little messy with the article tag and the sections.

### Continued development

Looking forward to the next project for which I will be more prepared, hence I will organize the core structure better.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This was very helpful for centering the components
