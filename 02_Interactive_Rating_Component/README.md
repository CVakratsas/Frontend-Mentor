## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Prettier(Code formatter)

### What I learned

I got more accustomed with the CSS selectors, I tried to create reusable CSS classes and I converted divs into radio buttons. Furthermore, I used JS for the first time in a project and I dowloaded Prettier - a code formatter which is used to structure your code evenly.

### Continued development

I feel confident using the flexbox to align items so I will aim to use the gridbox for the next project.

### Useful resources

- [Using divs as radio buttons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32935435/use-div-as-radio-button) - This was the approach I used for the circular ratting radio buttons.
